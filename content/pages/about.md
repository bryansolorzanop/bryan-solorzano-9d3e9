![A woman using a laptop](/images/about.jpg)

As a marketer, I loved to learn about everything that is included in the process, I know how to shoot a photo, even I know how to create something in Adobe Illustrator, also I can manage ads on Facebook and Google, I never stop learning. I called myself a *swiss tool* for every moment.

## Credentials

I have a degree in marketing, which means that I know how to create strategies for successful offline products. my degree plus my experience in the digital marketing environment just let me be a good fit for every company and brand that needs my assistance.

My 5 years of experience have taught me to effectively identify what the people need from the brands I work for.
